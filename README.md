### üõ†Ô∏è My Toolkit & Learning Journey:

I'm actively expanding my proficiency in the following technologies:

**Languages:**
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/)
[![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-2196F3?style=for-the-badge&logo=r&logoColor=white)](https://www.r-project.org/)

**Frameworks & Libraries:**
[![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-FF6F00?style=for-the-badge&logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white)](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
[![Keras](https://img.shields.io/badge/Keras-D00000?style=for-the-badge&logo=keras&logoColor=white)](https://keras.io/)
[![Scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-F7931E?style=for-the-badge&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)](https://scikit-learn.org/)
[![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-150458?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white)](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
[![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/NumPy-013243?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)](https://numpy.org/)
[![Biopython](https://img.shields.io/badge/Biopython-1976D2?style=for-the-badge&logo=biopython&logoColor=white)](https://biopython.org/)

*Note: Shields.io badges provide solid background colors. The "blueish gradient" effect across badges is achieved by using distinct shades of blue for related tools.*

### üìà My GitHub Activity:

**Important Note regarding Contributions:** If your contributions are not showing correctly (e.g., 0 contributions despite having activity), it might be due to caching by the `github-readme-stats` service. I've added a parameter to encourage it to refresh more frequently. Please ensure your contributions are public or that `count_private=true` is correctly set in the URL (which it is). Also, confirm your contributions are visible on your actual GitHub profile page.

# For testing, try this (then push, clear browser cache, check profile):
![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Marzan1&show_icons=true&theme=radical&hide_border=true&count_private=true&cache_seconds=0)
